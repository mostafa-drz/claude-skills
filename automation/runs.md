# Daily Skill Factory — Run Log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. The routine reads this file at the start of every run to decide whether Phase A should fire and to keep status fresh for the last ~7 rows.

Schema and semantics: see [`daily-skill-routine.md` §8](./daily-skill-routine.md#8-runsmd-schema).
